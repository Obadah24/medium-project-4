### In brief about the medium project about React Shopping Cart Application with Redux Toolkit.

### Overall Content of App

- The application boasts a login screen that smoothly updates the Redux state upon clicking the login button. This seamless transition to shopping cart feature allows us to efficiently manage the state of cart through Redux stores. To guarantee data persistence, sent this information to the backend via Firebase and handle HTTP states through notifications.

- Provided real-time feedback through notifications imported Material UI when adding items to the cart, indicating successful requests or errors. incorporated a dummy product to display on the screen.

- The entire state of the application, including cart items, total price, and login/logout screens, is dynamically handled with Redux Toolkit and fetched through Firebase. This approach ensures efficient management of the data and allows for seamless integration of new features in the future.

# src/index.js

- This code is importing the "configureStore" function from the "@reduxjs/toolkit" library, which is a popular library used for state management in JavaScript applications. It is also importing three different "slices" of state from separate files: "authSlice", "cartSlice", and "uiSlice". These slices represent different parts of the application's state that need to be managed and updated independently.

- The "configureStore" function is then called with an object that contains the reducers for each slice of state. A reducer is a function that takes in the current state and an action, and returns a new state based on that action. In this case, the reducers for each slice are passed in as properties of the "reducer" object.

- Finally, the resulting store object is exported as the default export of this module. This store object contains all of the application's state, and can be accessed and updated by any part of the application that needs to use it.

# src/App.js

- This code is a React component that renders the main application interface. It imports several components and functions from different files and libraries, including the "Auth" component, the "Layout" component, and the "fetchData" and "sendCartData" functions from the "cartActions" file in the application's store directory.

- The component also uses two hooks from the "react-redux" library: "useSelector" and "useDispatch". These hooks allow the component to access and update the application's state stored in the Redux store.

- The component has two "useEffect" hooks. The first one dispatches an action to fetch data from the server when the component mounts. The second one checks if the "cart" slice of state has changed, and if so, dispatches an action to send the updated cart data to the server.

- The component conditionally renders either the "Auth" component or the "Layout" component based on whether the user is logged in or not. It also conditionally renders a "Notification" component if there is a notification message in the application's state.
